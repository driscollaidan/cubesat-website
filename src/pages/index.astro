		Mission Objectives

		MO.1
		Operate the PMPD propulsion system in LEO to execute an orbit-raising or lowering maneuver.

		MO.2
		Determine the key performance metrics of the PMPD system in LEO including impulse bit, specific impulse, and total efficiency of power to thrust conversion.

		MO.3
		Continuously record the propulsion system health metrics during thruster operation including average power consumption, propellant injector temperature, propellant tank level, and current/voltage waveforms for the discharge and igniter circuits.

		Overall CONOPS and Experiment Plan

		FE.1 (1.5 hours)
		Thruster checkouts
		* Fire single prograde pulse
		* Measure thruster health metrics (voltage and current waveforms)
		* Downlink results + wait to proceed

		FE.2 (24 hours)
		Short-duration performance characterization
		Repeatedly pulse thruster and coast to recharge
		Gather data to allow for performance metrics (impulse bit, specific impulse, total efficiency)

		FE.3 (1-2 months)
		Long-duration performance characterization
		* Pulse 1 million times, in repeated orbit raising and lowering maneuvers
		* Stop periodically for systems check, data downlink, and orbit characterization
		* Collect health and performance metrics to reduce uncertainty for performance parameters and monitor the change in thruster behavior over its lifetime.
